## Why learn Travis CI

I want to become more familiar with the tools and concepts that are leveraged in DevOps.

## Where the inspiration comes from

All code/learning on using Travis comes from the [Learn Travis](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis#install-travis-cli-on-ubuntu) repo found when doing a Google search on getting started with Travis.
